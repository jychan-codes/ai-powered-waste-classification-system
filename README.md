# AI-Powered Waste Classification System

study addresses the lack of effective waste classification in Malaysia by developing an AI-powered system utilizing deep learning, which is Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The system allows users to upload or capture waste images for instant classification and provides eco-friendly disposal guidance. With training and validation accuracies of 80.66% and 77.62%, respectively, this project contributes toward Malaysia's goal of improving recycling rates and aligns with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals #12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and #13 (Climate Action).

## Efforts Undertaken

1. Conducted extensive research to understand waste management practices.
2. Collected and analyzed both primary and secondary data (waste images) to define the problem space.
3. Executed data preprocessing tasks, including cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and transformation, using Python.
4. Developed and trained a classification model using deep learning transfer learning.
5. Deployed the trained model into a user-friendly web application with database integration using XAMPP and MySQL, alongside Flask, PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
6. Performed system testing to ensure reliability and accuracy.
